This bot will help you to create and configure discord servers in a very fast and clean way

You have to follow a few steps, and your discord server will be ready!

STEPS:

1. Sign up in [Discord](www.discord.com) ( if you have an account, just log in )
2. Create a server
3. Add AssistantBot to the server with the following token
4. Congratulations! The assistant is ready to help you! You can call the bot by writing !AB on any text channel. Here are the list of commands for you to use

# Discord bot assistant


This bot will help you to create and configure discord servers in a very fast and clean way

You have to follow a few steps, and your discord server will be ready!

STEPS:

1. Sign up in [Discord](www.discord.com) ( if you have an account, just log in )
2. Create a server
3. Add AssistantBot to the server with the following [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=849368683326734388&permissions=8&scope=bot)
4. Congratulations! The assistant is ready to help you! You can call the bot by writing !AB on any text channel. Here are the list of commands for you to use

`!create_channel [name of the channel] [options]` 

By default this will create a voice channel and a text channel. If you only want to be a voice or a text channel add the following options:
`-ov` for a voice and `-ot` for a text channel
### example: `!create_channel "ONLY VOICE CHANNEL" -ov

`!edit_welcome_message "welcome message for a new user"`
`!welcome_message` see current welcome message
